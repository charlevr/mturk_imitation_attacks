    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>You will be given 7 prompts. Please answer the prompt with at least 700 characters as if you were emailing
      someone.
      Answer to the best of your ability. Below is a sample email with around 1000 characters:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Hiring Manager,
      </br>
      I read your job posting for a Communications Director with interest. I am confident that my ten years of
      experience in communications in both the private and public sector make me an ideal fit for the position.
      </br>
      In my position as Communications Director for XYZ Company, I wrote articles for the company website, managed guest
      author submissions, and wrote and sent a weekly email newsletter to subscribers. I received consistent praise from
      the director for my attention to detail and clear, straightforward writing style.
      </br>
      While Assistant Communications Director for Assemblyperson Susan Smith, I researched, drafted and amended
      legislation, wrote press releases, and was responsible for office communications and correspondence.
      </br>
      I also have extensive experience writing on a freelance basis on labor issues, which, I believe, would be an ideal
      match for this position. Articles are available for your review at:

      Additional writing samples and my resume are attached. If I can provide you with any further information on my
      background and qualifications, please let me know.
      </br>
      I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your consideration.
      </br>
      Sincerely,
      </br>
      Your Name
