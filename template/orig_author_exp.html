        Oh hey Dad! How's it going? Let me tell you about my day today, you won't believe it. First of
        all, I woke up late and so I had to hurry and run to the bus stop. On my way to the bus stop I was trying
        to review for my final when I tripped on air and went flying to the ground! It's okay though, I was still able
        to make it to the bus stop. I scratched up my legs and arms kind of bad but I had more important things to worry
        about! So I stood up, dusted myself off and continued my sprint to the bus stop. As I was running and looking at
        my notes I realized that I had the wrong notebook with me! Everything was still fine though because eventually
        I made it to the bus stop and I was actually on time for the test! Anyways, the test went okay but I was still
        scratched up and sore from faceplanting onto the ground. It could've been much worse though! Anyways, hope your
        day was less stressful than mine Dad!
